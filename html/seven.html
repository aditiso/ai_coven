<ul id="animate">I like to think (and</ul>
<ul id="animate" >the sooner the better!)</ul>
<ul id="animate">the sooner the better!)</ul>
<ul id="animate">of a cybernetic meadow</ul>
<ul id="animate">where mammals and computers</ul>
<ul id="animate">live together in mutually</ul>
<ul id="animate">programming harmony</ul>
<ul id="animate">like pure water</ul>
<ul id="animate">touching clear sky.</ul>


<ul>I like to think</ul>
<ul>(right now, please!)</ul>
<ul>of a cybernetic forest</ul>
<ul>filled with pines and electronics</ul>
<ul>where deer stroll peacefully</ul>
<ul>past computers</ul>
<ul>as if they were flowers</ul>
<ul>with spinning blossoms.</ul>

<ul>I like to think</ul>
<ul>(it has to be!)</ul>
<ul>of a cybernetic ecology</ul>
<ul>where we are free of our labors</ul>
<ul>and joined back to nature,</ul>
<ul>returned to our mammal</ul>
<ul>brothers and sisters,</ul>
<ul>and all watched over</ul>
<ul>by machines of loving grace.</ul>
