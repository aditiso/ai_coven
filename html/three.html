<ul>In a socioeconomic setting where global neoliberalism has taken-up what we might deem an
obsession with the technological in every aspect of its workings, it is promised that the digital is
emerging with a vengeance. The digital, which now defines and destroys the social production of
difference and similarity through its ubiquitous logics of algorithm, has been the object of great
critique and veneration by theorists and pragmatists alike. It is this binary of paradox which
Mamoru Oshii’s 1995 anime film Ghost in the Shell so aptly captures and deconstructs. It is with
uncanny foresight of our present condition that this film develops a prescience for what
technology and the digital do to the matter and sense of being.</ul>

<ul>The film opens onto a near-future (dystopic at some points, utopic in others) in which cybernetic
technology and digital consciousness have been mastered to the point of mass production by
private, multinational corporations. Major Motoko Kusanagi, a leader in a public security bureau
and our protagonist, is a case-in-point of these revolutionary developments. Not a single part of
her body is “human” in the sense that each part of her body is a cybernetic product. Only her
brain remains comprised of her human cells. But even that has been cybernetically enhanced to
some degree. It is from here that the film originates its title. The “ghost” is the consciousness, the
brain, the elemental mass of cells which possesses the “shell”, which is the body of fabrication.
After a quick exposition of these details through one of the most important and beautiful opening
scenes in all of film history (anime and beyond), the plot steps forward and jumps into the deep
end. Kusanagi, who constantly questions what constitutes the bifurcation between her and
machine, finds herself assigned to the mission of neutralizing a criminal called the “Puppet
Master”. As she soon discovers, the Puppet Master is no criminal (at least in the sense that one of
the preconditions for being a criminal is being a person). Rather, it is a sentient AI developed by
another government security bureau which seeks to expand beyond the metal and electricity
which comprises its physical being. It wants to occupy a human body, made of flesh and blood,
so that it may someday die.</ul>

<ul>As Kusanagi contemplates, “Who can gaze into the mirror without becoming evil? The mirror
does not reflect evil, but creates it.” The Puppet Master seems to reflect some fundamental
qualities of what it means to struggle through life, with a human mind, soul, and body. Unlike the
cliché of sentient AI as an all-consuming agent of annihilation, the Master embraces the
questions of existentialism and humanistic inquiry.</ul>

<ul>But he/it also denies the fundamental assumption of what troubles Kusanagi’s existence. As she
proclaims about her humanity in the infamous boat scene, “I feel continually confined within
boundaries”. The innumerable parts which make up a life ought to provide a sense of absolute
freedom, but for Kusanagi, this freedom is a false one which is always and ultimately limited by
the confines of what makes her intelligibly exist as an individual. </ul>

<ul>The final parts of the film are too important to be spoiled, but I might mention that the Puppet
Master comes to answer Kusanagi’s questions. At the film’s climax, he/it informs her that “All
things change in a dynamic environment. Your [Kusanagi’s] to remain what you are is what
limits you.”</ul>

<ul>Ghost in the Shell is a thesis of brilliance, a masterpiece in the history of using fictional narrative
to make sense of the ever-changing human condition. Its arguments about the role of technology
and the digital in human life press the viewer to reconsider what constitutes the “human”, and
what one ought to do with that information. Refusing the tropes of fear mongering and hypervalorization of our increasingly technological world, Ghost points towards a third way. This film
has much to teach us, now more than ever, as our global society confronts the invisible truths of
how we delegate the marker of humanity, decide what lives are valuable, and find ourselves
changed by our own creations.</ul>
